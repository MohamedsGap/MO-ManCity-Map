# My final project for Udacity ND program called: MO manCityMap (React) Project!


# MO ManCity Map (React)

This Website shows my locations around my favorite team Man City (Manchester, UK).
The user can click on any of the locations to see its name and a nice picture of
it.

## APIs & Frameworks
I have used the google Maps API for the map, which I will show the locations on.
The pictures that the user sees when he clicks on the markers are from the FourSquare
API. The whole website is built with React.Js.

## Installation
open the project directory in the command line and type "npm install" to install
the necessary project dependencies. Then type "npm start" to run the react development
server. This will automatically open your browser on "localhost:3000" where you
will be able to interact with the site.

## Usage
When the page loads, markers are rendered on to the map on the 5 locations. When
the user clicks on the hamburger icon, a sidebar shows with the 5 locations names.
The user can click on one of them to see the info-window with the locations name
and picture. The user can also click on the marker to see those informations. The
user can also filter the list to search for a specific location he is interested in.

## Accessibility
The user can tab through the page to show the different locations. Although he
can't tab the markers on the map, he can tab the list-items and therefore access
any location he needs.

## Templates & Styling
I used bootstrap to style my page. I also used a nice template for the sidebar with
the hamburger icon from https://bootstrapious.com/p/bootstrap-sidebar.
